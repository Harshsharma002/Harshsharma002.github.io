# FEM

The FEM is a general numerical method for solving partial differential equations in two or three space variables (i.e., some boundary value problems). To solve a problem, the FEM subdivides a large system into smaller, simpler parts called finite elements. This is achieved by a particular space discretization in the space dimensions, which is implemented by the construction of a mesh of the object: the numerical domain for the solution, which has a finite number of points. The finite element method formulation of a boundary value problem finally results in a system of algebraic equations. The method approximates the unknown function over the domain. The simple equations that model these finite elements are then assembled into a larger system of equations that models the entire problem. The FEM then approximates a solution by minimizing an associated error function via the calculus of variations.

# HISTORY OF FEM 
FEM simulations play their part in the production development process by assisting the user at an early stage to assess whether the essential requirements have been met and to ensure that they are fulfilled.
Questions regarding what lies at the heart of such simulations and of how the associated mathematics developed and came to be applied may never have crossed the mind of today’s computational engineers and they may never have even heard anything about such matters.\
The following provides a brief overview of where it all began and of the historical development of the finite element method, giving due regard to Berkeley, which played a significant role in its development.
Ray W. Clough of the University of California coined the term “finite element method” and, along with John H. Argyris of Imperial College, London, and Stuttgart Technical University, he is considered the inventor of the finite element method.

# DEVELOPMENT OF FEM

#### 1.Origins (1940s-1950s):
The origins of FEM can be traced back to the 1940s with early work by engineers and mathematicians.
Researchers like Richard Courant, Kurt Friedrichs, and Mary Tsingou developed methods for solving partial differential equations numerically.

#### 2. Structural Analysis (1950s-1960s):
The method gained prominence in the 1950s and 1960s due to its application in solving structural engineering problems.
Engineers such as Ray W. Clough and Olgierd Zienkiewicz contributed significantly to the development of FEM for structural analysis.
The focus was on solving elasticity and structural mechanics problems.

#### 3. Generalization and Expansion (1960s-1970s):
Olgierd Zienkiewicz's work in the 1960s played a crucial role in generalizing FEM to various fields, beyond structural analysis.
The concept of dividing domains into smaller finite elements and deriving approximations within those elements became more widespread.
Researchers extended FEM to heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and other scientific areas.

#### 4. Commercial Software (1970s-1980s):
The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of commercial FEM software packages, making the method accessible to a broader range of engineers and scientists.
Software like ANSYS and NASTRAN gained popularity for their versatility in solving various engineering problems.

#### 5. Advancements in Computing (1980s-Present):
The increasing power of computers and advancements in numerical methods further propelled FEM's development.
Parallel computing and advanced solvers led to faster and more accurate simulations.
FEM is now a cornerstone of engineering design and analysis, used in industries ranging from aerospace to biomedical engineering.

#### 6. Integration with CAD (Computer-Aided Design):
Integration of FEM with CAD software allowed engineers to directly import geometric models into FEM analysis tools.
This integration streamlined the design and analysis process, enabling more efficient iteration and optimization.

#### 7. Multidisciplinary Applications:
FEM's applicability expanded to encompass multidisciplinary simulations, where the interaction between different physical phenomena is analyzed simultaneously.
Examples include fluid-structure interaction, thermal-electrical coupling, and more.

#### 8. High-Performance Computing and Simulation-Based Design:
With the advent of high-performance computing, FEM simulations could tackle even larger and more complex problems.
Simulation-based design approaches, where engineers iterate designs through simulations rather than physical prototyping, gained traction.

#### 9. Future Trends:
FEM continues to evolve with the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.
Reduced-order modeling and real-time simulations are becoming more relevant in various industries.
